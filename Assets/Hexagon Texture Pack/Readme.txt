Thanks for purchasing the hexagon texture pack! 
I hope it will serve you well.


Notes:

----
The set will be updated with new materials from time to time and you will get them for free, assuming that the 3d market 
you bought it on in allows buyers to access new versions.
      
----
I encourage you to try out some weirder combinations of diffuse/specular/normal maps, there's a chance that you will discover something cool that I never thought of.
----
If you have any questions, ideas or feedback, send me a mail at artofblaze@gmail.com
I'm also (usually) available for freelance work, in case you're looking for something more custom.
You can check out my portfolio at b-kaczmarek.weebly.com to see what kind of stuff i usually do.


Also, stay in tune for my other products that will get released eventually.
